# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten digit recognition using knn algorithm

dataset used: mnist dataset

in the last cells, the accuracy for different values of k along with the time taken in seconds to compute it is also shown
for calculating accuracy, sample size of 100 has been used
while calculating accuracy, the wrong predictions are also shown
